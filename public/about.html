<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! 👋 My name is Aman Bajwa, and I'm an aspiring web developer currently learning the ropes through a web development Bootcamp on Udemy. 
  I’ve just started my journey with HTML and have already completed several lessons. 
  Every new tag, attribute, and concept excites me as I bring ideas to life on the screen!

</p>

<p>I’m passionate about creating functional and visually appealing websites while continuously improving my skills. 
  In addition to web development, I enjoy exploring creative outlets like sharing calming and relaxing tips on Instagram, walking my adorable Goldendoodle, Rocko 🐾,
   and learning about digital marketing.

</p>

<p>I’m looking forward to mastering more tools and technologies and building projects that showcase my growth. 
  This portfolio is a work in progress, just like me, but I can’t wait to see where this journey takes me!

</p>
<p>Let’s connect and create something amazing together! 🚀
